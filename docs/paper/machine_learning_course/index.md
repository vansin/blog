## What is Machine Learning

### Define1

Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.


### Define2

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather data, and have it learn to predict weather. In this setting, what is T?

- Experience E
- Task T
- Performance P
